# VirtualLeverless
VirtualLeverless is an open-source application that allows you to create and modify custom 'Leverless' controller layouts, 
much like a virtual [hitbox](https://github.com/jfedor2/flatbox). 

The [current release](https://github.com/jackjburnett/VirtualLeverless/releases/tag/v0.2) is available on 
[Android](https://github.com/jackjburnett/VirtualLeverless/releases/download/v0.2/Android.apk) 
and [Windows](https://github.com/jackjburnett/VirtualLeverless/releases/download/v0.2/Windows.zip).

Layouts created using this software can be used to control a Windows PC over Wi-Fi, 
using [VirtualLeverless Receiver](https://jackjburnett.github.io/VirtualLeverlessReceiver/). 
Instructions on how to do so, and how to use the VirtualLeverless software can be found below.
